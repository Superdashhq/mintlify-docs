<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Log in to the Superdash Dashboard, navigate to **Modules > Extraction**, and define the custom variables you need to extract for your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Navigate to **Modules > Webhooks** and add your custom webhook to receive the extracted data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step (Optional)">
    The variables you specified will automatically be extracted from conversations and sent to your configured webhook at the end of each call. If needed, use the [**Extract Conversation Data API** ](/docs/mintlify-docs/api-reference/endpoint/EXTRACTION/extraction-specific-conversation.mdx) to retry the extraction for a specific conversation.
