<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Log in to the Superdash Dashboard, navigate to **Modules > Extraction**, and define the custom variables you need to extract for your workspace. 
    
    By default, the following are automatically extracted and passed to the webhook.
    ### Call
    ```json
     {
      "summary": "summary of the conversation",
      "conversation": "transcript of the conversation",
      "conversationId": "Id of the conversation",
      "CallId": "Id of the call",
      "callDuration": "Duration of the call",
      "callStartTime": "Start time of the call"
    }
     ```
     ### Sms
     ```json
     {
      "summary": "summary of the conversation",
      "conversation": "transcript of the conversation",
      "conversationId": "Id of the conversation",
    }
     ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Navigate to **Modules > Webhooks** and add your custom webhook to receive the extracted data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step (Optional)">
    The variables you specified will automatically be extracted from conversations and sent to your configured webhook at the end of each call. If needed, use the [**Extract Conversation Data API** ](/api-reference/endpoint/EXTRACTION/extraction-specific-conversation) to retry the extraction for a specific conversation.
  </Step>
